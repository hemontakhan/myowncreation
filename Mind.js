                 1.As a holistic medical science, Ayurveda acknowledges regular body work
                  as part of a healthy lifestyle.The term shirodhara comes from the Sanskrit words shiro (head) and dhara (flow). It is a traditional Ayurvedic body therapy where a steady, gentle stream of warm oil
                   is continuously poured over the forehead to help soothe and heal a frayed nervous system.  According to Ayurvedic teachings, the gentle but constant application of oil stimulates healthy 
                   blood circulation to the brain and pituitary gland, while certain added herbs and essences can provide relief from symptoms of anxiety, migraines, insomnia and neuralgia. 
Shirodhara works primarily on the mental sheath or “manomaya kosha,” as it is referred to in Ayurveda. It is designed to cultivate a sense of deep mind/body relaxation from head to toe, giving your nervous system the opportunity to begin repairing itself organically. Studies show that Shirodhara leads to a state of alert calmness similar to the relaxation response observed in meditation
